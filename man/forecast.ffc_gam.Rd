\usage{
\method{forecast}{ffc_gam}(
  object,
  newdata,
  type = "response",
  model = "ARIMA",
  stationary = FALSE,
  summary = TRUE,
  robust = TRUE,
  probs = c(0.025, 0.1, 0.9, 0.975),
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{ffc_gam}. See \code{\link[=ffc_gam]{ffc_gam()}}}

\item{newdata}{\code{dataframe} or \code{list} of test data containing the
same variables that were included in the original \code{data} used to fit the
model. The covariate information in \code{newdata}, along with the temporal information
indexed by the \code{time} variable in the original call to \code{ffc_gam()}, will be used to
generate forecasts from the fitted model equations}

\item{type}{When this has the value \code{link}, the linear predictor is calculated
on the link scale. If \code{expected} is used, predictions reflect the expectation
of the response (the mean) but ignore uncertainty in the observation process.
When \code{response} is used (the default), the predictions take uncertainty in the observation
process into account to return predictions on the outcome scale}

\item{model}{A \code{character} string representing a valid univariate model definition
from the \pkg{fable} package or one of the built-in Bayesian dynamic
factor models. Note that if a \pkg{fable} model is used,
the chosen method must have an associated
\code{generate()} method in order to simulate forecast realisations. Valid models
currently include: \code{'ARDF'}, \code{'GPDF'}, '\code{VARDF},
\code{'ETS'}, \code{'ARIMA'}, \code{'AR'}, \code{'RW'}, \code{'NAIVE'}, and \code{'NNETAR'}}

\item{stationary}{If \code{TRUE}, the fitted time series models are
constrained to be stationary. Default is \code{FALSE}. This option
only works when \code{model == 'ARIMA'}}

\item{summary}{Should summary statistics be returned instead of the raw values?
Default is \code{TRUE}}

\item{robust}{If \code{FALSE} (the default) the mean is used as the measure of
central tendency and the standard deviation as the measure of variability.
If \code{TRUE}, the median and the median absolute deviation (MAD) are applied instead.
Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}}

\item{probs}{The percentiles to be computed by the \code{quantile()} function.
Only used if \code{summary} is \code{TRUE}}

\item{...}{Other arguments to pass to the Stan dynamic factor models}
}
\value{
Predicted values on the appropriate scale.
If \code{summary == FALSE}, the output is a matrix. If \code{summary == TRUE}, the output
is a tidy \code{tbl_df / data.frame}
