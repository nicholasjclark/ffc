Description: Perform functional regression using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) that enable functional responses to be modelled and predicted with a broad range of predictor effects. The package also handles functional predictors with time-varying coefficients that can be forecasted ahead using a variety of efficient forecasting algorithms, providing unmatched flexibility to model and predict how functional responses change over time.
