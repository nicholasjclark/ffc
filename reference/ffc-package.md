# ffc: Functional ForeCasting

Perform functional regression using Generalized Additive Models (GAMs)
that enable functional responses to be modelled and predicted with a
broad range of predictor effects. The package also handles functional
predictors with time-varying coefficients that can be forecasted ahead
using a variety of efficient forecasting algorithms, providing unmatched
flexibility to model and predict how functional responses change over
time.
